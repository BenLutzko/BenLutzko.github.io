<h1 style="text-align:center;font-size:200%"> Signal Filtering and Analysis </h1>

<ul>
 <li> This MATLAB script creates a signal in which we want to filter. In order to do this, we must inspect the power spectrum and use a lowpass filter in order to remove what we deem as “noise”. To do this we do a Fourier transform to obtain the power spectrum and plot it over the frequency of the signal in the frequency domain.</li>

 <li> Then create and apply a filter using two different methods to compare as plotted in this subplot. Lastly comparing the final results. </li>

 <li> Lastly analysis and filtering of IMU (inertial measurement unit) data during two different style lacrosse pass fakes. First raw data, then the important signals to analyze.</li>
