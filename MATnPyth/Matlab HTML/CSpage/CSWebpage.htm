<h2 style="text-align:center;font-size:150%">For the Bones of the Foot and Ankle Bones</h2>

<p> - Funded by Alberta Innovates to complete a summer studentship in the Clinical Movement Assessment Lab at Calgaryâ€™s Foothills hospital.<br><br>  - Developed, tested and analyzed a consistent and automated method for assigning local coordinate systems to the foot and ankle using Principal Component Analysis.<br><br></p>

<p><br><br><br>Local coordinate systems for 38 bones overlaid (8 for cubiod) <br>*note: Top right = calcaneus, top left = talus, bottom right = navicular, bottom left = cuboid.</p>

<p><br><br><br> Average angle deviation plot. Further analysis was done to assess if there was correlation between deviation angle and bone size, as well as if angle deviation was different between males and females (not shown). There was no correlation or significant difference found for both tests.</p>

<p><br><br><br> High cuboid deviation we believe is due to the low sample size (n=8) and the irregular shape. </p>
