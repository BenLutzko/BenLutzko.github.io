            <h2>Current Work</h2>
            <p>Currently working on my undergraduate honours thesis project (BCs – Biomechanics – Honours stream) using skin marker motion capture and dual fluoroscopy motion capture to asses foot kinematics when running in carbon plated shoes. I will use this first project section to explain dual fluoroscopy (DF) through graphics I have created.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>DF allows the construction of a 3D video X-ray. The overlapping field of view (yellow square on figure) is where we can capture the bone motion </li>
               
                <li>Using software, we place a 3D model of an individual’s bones in this field of view and align the model to each frame. This can be seen in the second GIF with the 3D bone motion on the top</li>
                
                <li>This project consists of having individuals run on a tread mill in 3 different shoe conditions: barefoot, shoe, and stiff shoe. We will track the skin marker and DF motion capture data and process both</li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>This project we want to compare the motion capture data from skin marker motion capture and DF, to see if certain calculated metrics differ when looking at carbon plated running shoes!</b></p>

                <h2>Previous Project Summer 2024</h2>
                <p>Individuals with cerebral palsy (CP) are sometimes prescribed ankle and foot orthoses (AFOs) which are an external foot and ankle brace to help manage pain and improve mobility. However little research has been done to look at how or if these AFOs benefit patients biomechanically. This lack of research likely stems from the difficulty of tracking bone motion with traditional methods like skin marker motion capture with the brace and shoes in the way.</p><br>
                <p><b>Therefore I worked on this project to assess the feasibility of using dual fluoroscopy to image the tibiotalar joint of individuals with cerebral palsy while wearing AFOs</b>.</p> <br>
                <p>Using this technology in this setting has many implications, however we were able to work as a team to work around this issues to find it is in fact possible to track bone motion in this population.</p>
